## Overview  
This project implements a relational database for managing a food manufacturing system.  
It supports products, ingredients, suppliers, and manufacturers, along with recipe versioning, batch tracking, and safety constraints.

The design includes:
- A fully normalized schema (all tables in 3NF or BCNF)  
- Functional dependencies that guided decomposition  
- Triggers and stored procedures for enforcing business logic  
- Application-level login and role-based access

See the report (`Database_Design_Report.tex`) and ER diagram (`Final ER Diagram.pdf`) for full documentation.
